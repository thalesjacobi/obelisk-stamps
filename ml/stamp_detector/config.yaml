# YOLO Training Configuration for Stamp Detection
# This file defines the dataset structure and class names

# Dataset paths (absolute to avoid YOLO resolving relative paths incorrectly)
path: D:/CodingFolder/obelisk-stamps/ml/stamp_detector/training_data
train: images        # Training images (relative to path)
val: images          # Validation images (relative to path) - will be split automatically

# Class names
names:
  0: stamp

# Number of classes
nc: 1

# Training parameters (can be overridden in train.py)
# These are reasonable defaults for stamp detection
